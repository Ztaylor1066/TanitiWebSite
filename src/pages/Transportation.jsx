        Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
        small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.
        Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
        propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so
        larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few
        years.

        Taniti City is easy to explore on foot, thanks to its flat terrain and
        walkable layout. Public buses operate within the city from 5 a.m. to 11
        p.m., while private buses serve other parts of the island. Taxis are
        available in the city, and rental cars can be obtained near the airport.
        Bicycles and helmets (required by law) are available from multiple
        vendors.
