      <h3 className="about">
        Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has
        an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and
        includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
        tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small,
        active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000.
        Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was
        dominated by fishing or agriculture.
